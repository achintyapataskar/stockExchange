Convert to struct and pass to Action Handler
    Keep a uniform format for all types of orders
    Create Action Handler thread
    Store data to log (in case recovery is needed) (check QuickFIX inbuilt features)
    Call action handler
    If action handler returns successfully:
        return positive acknowledgement to client
    else:
        recover the data from log and try again
    if Action Handler fails too many times:
        return negative acknowledgement to client
